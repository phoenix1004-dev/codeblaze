    qu: "What is Codeblaze?",
    an: "Codeblaze is an AI-driven platform that automates the entire coding process, enabling users to create full-stack applications effortlessly. With features like text prompts, voice-to-code, and image-based code generation, it simplifies development from start to finish.",
  },
  {
    qu: "How does Codeblaze work?",
    an: "Codeblaze uses advanced AI to process your input—whether it’s a text prompt, voice command, or uploaded image—and generates clean, functional code. It handles everything from analysis to deployment-ready solutions, minimizing user intervention.",
  },
  {
    qu: "Why is Codeblaze 100 times faster if it’s only a 1:10 ratio?",
    an: "The 1:10 ratio reflects the time saved on individual tasks (1 hour for Codeblaze versus 10 hours for a senior developer). However, Codeblaze operates continuously and autonomously, handling multiple projects and tasks simultaneously without downtime. This scalability enables it to achieve results equivalent to 100 times the output of traditional development over time.",
  },
  {
    qu: "What types of projects can I build with Codeblaze?",
    an: "Codeblaze supports a wide variety of projects, including web apps, mobile apps, and cross-platform solutions. Whether you’re creating a simple tool or a complex enterprise application, Codeblaze adapts to fit your needs.",
